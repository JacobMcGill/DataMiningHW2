To estimate out of sample performance for these 3 models, we will use K-fold cross validation with K = 10

## Data Validation
```{r, include = TRUE}
hotels_val = read.csv("C://Users/jacob/Downloads/hotels_val.csv", header = TRUE)
hotels_val = hotels_val %>%
  mutate(month = month(arrival_date),
         summer = ifelse(month >= 6 & month <= 8, 1, 0),
         week_day = wday(arrival_date),
         weekend_arrival = ifelse(week_day == 5|week_day == 6, 1, 0)
         )
predict_val = predict(engineered_model, hotels_val)
roc_graph = roc(hotels_val$children, predict_val)
plot(roc_graph, main = "ROC Curve" , col = "blue")
ggplot(data = coords(roc_graph), aes(x = 1 - specificity, y = sensitivity)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "ROC Curve") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Fold test
```{r, include =TRUE}
val_folds = createFolds(hotels_val$children, k=20, list = TRUE)
predict_child = foreach(i=seq_along(val_folds), .combine = "c") %dopar%{
  current_fold = val_folds[[i]]
  data_fold = hotels_dev[current_fold,]
  predicted_child = predict(engineered_model, data_fold)
  sum(predicted_child)
}
barplot(predict_child, names.arg = seq_along(val_folds), xlab = "Fold", ylab = "Sum of Predicted Values", main = "Sum of Predicted Values for Each Fold")
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
